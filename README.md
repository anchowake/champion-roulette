## TODO
* cache the Champions results after the first fetch
* use the cached Champions data and do not fetch again (we already got all the data after the first fetch)
* filter the results depending on the selected role (do not mutate the results)
* prevent fetching/filtering if the current active Role is clicked again

## Nice to have
* make it reposive
* remove bootstrap dependency
* remove jquery dependency
* remove glyphicon dependency
